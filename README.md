# CS205
* Student name: Shir-Kang Scott, Jin

## Program structure
* main.cpp: Ensembels the general-search structure
* al.h: Class descriptions
* al.cpp: Implmentation of functions.  This file contains the main logic, please look at the "GeneralSearch" function that attempts to fit the general search algorithm

## How to use
* Use "make" to build the project
* run with " ./hw1 2 ./inputs/input8_1.txt" 
    * The number in the middle is for selecting the algorith
        * 1 for uniform cost search
        * 2 for manhatten distance
        * 3 for displaced time
